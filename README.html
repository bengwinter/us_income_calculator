<h3 id="about">About</h3>
<p>Monroe aggregates Twitter and news content and performs sentiment analysis while building associations between collected content and a database of federal politicians. Monroe also collects voting records and bill sponsorships (source: New York Times) for all politicians that are being tracked. </p>
<h3 id="access-configuration">Access &amp; Configuration</h3>
<p>There are currently three endpoints accessible from this wrapper:</p>
<p>  Monroe::Articles
  Monroe::Tweets
  Monroe::Records
  Monroe::Bills</p>
<p>To access the data from these endpoints, you will first need to request an API key and configure the client with this key. If you do not already have a key, you can generate one by querying the API&#39;s generator endpoint with your email as a parameter:</p>
<p>  www.monroeapi.com/api_key?email=your_email@example.com</p>
<p>Once you have your key, you can configure the client by setting the key in an initializer file of simply at the top of your program:</p>
<p>  Monroe.key = YOUR_API_KEY</p>
<p>Once the key is configured, you&#39;re good to go. Refer to the following documentation to access each endpoint.</p>
